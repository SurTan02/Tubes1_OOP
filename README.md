# TUGAS BESAR 1 IF2210 Pemrograman Berorientasi Objek

> The purpose of this project is to design a command line interface-based prototype of the crafting mechanism based on Minecraft using the C++ programming language. In designing the project, we were asked to use some of the object-oriented concepts that we have learned in class, namely:
1. Inheritance and Polymorphism
2. Exception and Exception Handling
3. Function Overloading and Operator Overloading
4. Abstract Class and Virtual Function
5. Generic Functions and Generic Class
6. STL (Standard Template Library)

- src folder containing implementaion files of the header files from include folder
- tests folder containing two sample test files (input and answer)
- main.cpp containing the main code
- check.cpp containing the code for checking
- makefile for compiling and testing
